# RevDistrict integrations and launch handoff

The app is a working Next.js build. It is not yet connected to RevDistrict's production DMS or deployed to the dealership domain. No production messages were sent while building it.

## Inventory: keep dealr.cloud as the source of truth

The preview contains 262 vehicles captured from the public dealer site on September 23, 2026, including original photos, prices, mileage, specifications, descriptions and equipment. These are review data, not a live feed. Preview pages label this clearly and are noindex by default. All old vehicle paths resolve through the catch-all route, including slashes and punctuation in trim names.

The source dealer site's body-type filters were used to classify vehicles: 92 cars, 113 SUVs, 35 trucks, 10 vans, and 12 other vehicles. Do not infer classes from model-name substrings. A few source records advertise mileage as zero; these display as mileage on request instead of implying an unused vehicle.

Dealr.cloud documents inventory export feeds and receiving leads from third-party providers. The dealer authorizes feed setup in Manage → Settings → Feeds; custom destinations require coordination with their support team. This is an available integration route, not evidence that a RevDistrict feed is already approved or active.

### What is implemented

`src/lib/inventory.ts` loads a server-only HTTPS JSON endpoint from `INVENTORY_FEED_URL`, optionally using `INVENTORY_FEED_TOKEN` as a bearer credential. A Zod contract in `src/lib/vehicle.ts` validates it; only active records display. Responses are cached for five minutes. Missing configuration uses the clearly labeled preview. A configured but failed, invalid, or older-than-36-hours feed raises the page's designed error state instead of silently substituting the preview.

**The normalized JSON contract is ours. It is not a claimed dealr.cloud API schema.** After their actual export format is supplied, create one adapter that maps their feed into this contract. This may be a scheduled SFTP importer and HTTPS read endpoint, or a direct authenticated endpoint if offered. No undocumented private API or marketplace scraper is used. The existing website was only read to prepare this one-time preview.

The feed envelope is:

```json
{
  "capturedAt": "2026-09-23T20:00:00Z",
  "source": "RevDistrict authorized inventory feed",
  "vehicles": []
}
```

Use `vehicleSchema` for every record. Important fields: stable provider ID, legacy slug, VIN, stock, advertised price, mileage, make/model/trim, body type, drivetrain, transmission, engine, colors, ordered HTTPS image URLs, description paragraphs, equipment groups, CARFAX link, canonical source URL, and active/sold/inactive status. IDs and slugs must be mapped consistently from old listings. Do not index the preview as inventory for sale.

### Photo delivery contract

`src/lib/vehicle-images.ts` builds responsive photo widths only for the verified HTTPS `cdn.dealrimages.com` host, preserving all other URL parameters. Other provider image URLs remain unchanged, including signed URLs. The gallery preloads its first image, prepares only the next full photo after load (unless save-data is enabled), and loads small thumbnails lazily. These are presentation changes; the inventory schema, source of truth and feed adapter are unchanged.

Ask the production provider for stable, cacheable HTTPS image URLs and documented resizing behavior. If the final feed uses another CDN, add only its documented transform to the image helper after checking it against a real sample. Do not rewrite arbitrary hosts or signed query strings.

### Dealer/provider handoff, prepared for sending by the project owner

Ask Buddy to arrange the dealr.cloud introduction. The conversation screenshots establish that he offered to help; they are not permission to send messages or use the private phone numbers in those screenshots.

Request:
1. An authorized inventory export for a custom Next.js website, its format, authentication/delivery method and update frequency.
2. A sample with photos in display order, VIN/stock/provider ID, legacy website slug, price, mileage, features/equipment, disclosures, CARFAX links, and active/sold/inactive status.
3. Full-feed versus delta semantics, sold/deleted vehicle handling, image rights/URLs, expected inventory size and error monitoring.
4. An approved lead-delivery method, field mapping, test destination, CRM attribution, optional SMS-consent support, and confirmation semantics.
5. An approved integration for the new on-site credit application: financial-data endpoint or supported relay, authentication, field mapping, applicant/co-applicant handling, authorization wording/version, test destination and durable receipt semantics. Confirm how applications attach to inventory and CRM records.

Validate a price change, one new listing, reordered images, and a sold vehicle in a provider test feed before launch. Agree the sold-vehicle policy: currently removed active records render 404 and offer inventory navigation. A sold archive/410 response can be added if the dealer wants it.

Scraping Facebook or KSL back into this site is not the recommended architecture. It would make downstream listings the source of truth and add duplication and stale-availability problems. Feed marketplaces outward from dealr.cloud as they do today.

## Leads and forms

Contact, trade valuation, consignment, text-back, vehicle inquiry, and test-drive forms post to `/api/leads`. Browser and server validation check required information, consent, phone and email; the server checks origin, request size and content type, applies a honeypot and a bounded in-process rate limit, and sends only to a configured HTTPS relay. The text-back form requires a phone and explicit text consent instead of an email. No submissions are stored locally or logged. Tests use fictional data and isolated responses.

Configure `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL` and optionally `LEAD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` for the dealer-approved relay. The JSON body is a `Lead` from `src/lib/leads.ts`, plus an ID, source and timestamp. The request includes the same ID as `Idempotency-Key`. The relay must accept durably before returning 2xx and deduplicate that key. Map it to dealr.cloud's confirmed API/ADF/email method only after their specifications are known. A timed-out relay is reported as unconfirmed delivery, not success; do not automatically retry.

Map `intent: "consignment"` as a selling consultation with the existing vehicle fields; it is not a signed consignment agreement. Map `intent: "text"` as a request for a text response, preserving `textConsent: true`; this is not automatic SMS delivery. General contact consent and optional SMS consent must remain distinct. No consignment price, commission, guaranteed sale or financing approval is generated by this site.

Without a relay, the endpoint returns 503 and the form offers the dealer's existing phone and email. There is no fake success state. Test-drive submission requests a time; it never promises a confirmed appointment.

Before production, use the host's trusted reverse proxy configuration and shared edge/WAF rate limiting. The in-process limiter is appropriate for the local preview and a single process; it does not coordinate multiple replicas, and forwarded IPs must be sanitized by the host. Confirm relay data retention, access controls and encryption. No credit-application data, SSNs, bank details, or driver's licenses are collected in these forms.

The current public business email is retained until the owners supply a rebrand address. Do not substitute personal contacts from the supplied conversation.

## Financing: native application with a dedicated provider connection

All application links now stay at `/financing/apply`; vehicle pages preserve `?entry_id=<provider ID>`. `/financing/terms` explains the authorization, and `/privacy-policy` reflects the implemented data paths. The payment estimator remains browser-only and does not perform a credit check or submit its calculator values.

The public legacy application and its public form script were re-inspected September 24, 2026. The recreated field groups are identity/contact/DOB/SSN/license/bankruptcy, residence and housing payment, employment and monthly income, previous residence/employment when current tenure is under two years, the same groups for an optional co-applicant, optional trade details, vehicle interest, cash down and a message. The new flow separates applicant/co-applicant authorization and optional text consent. Shared validation and conditional fields live in `src/lib/finance-application.ts`.

The old script posts to relative `functions/submitFinanceAppForm` and `functions/submitContactForm` paths. These are **not a documented or approved third-party API**. This build does not post to them, bypass their controls, or claim a connection to dealr.cloud. The new normalized submission contract must be mapped through the provider's approved method. There is no generic email fallback for financial data.

### Enable only after the provider handoff

The application is reviewable but sensitive fields and submission remain disabled until all of these are configured on the server:

```dotenv
SITE_URL=https://your-approved-domain.example
FINANCE_APPLICATION_ENABLED=true
FINANCE_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-approved-finance-relay.example/applications
FINANCE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN=your-host-managed-secret
```

Use the host's secret settings, never client/public variables. The financial relay must be HTTPS and authenticated; local HTTP `SITE_URL` is allowed only for localhost fixture testing. Configure the normal lead relay separately. Remove obsolete `FINANCE_APPLICATION_URL` settings from old deployments.

`POST /api/finance` validates the exact site origin, JSON content type, a bounded 32 KB body, required/conditional fields, consents, honeypot and rate limit. It discards inactive co-applicant/history/trade fields before forwarding. A native POST fallback prevents unhydrated forms from putting information in a URL; JavaScript is needed to complete the guided flow. The application page is noindex, no-store and no-referrer. It has no analytics or session replay.

The relay receives an authenticated JSON request with an `Idempotency-Key` matching `id`:

```json
{
  "id": "generated-reference",
  "submittedAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "source": "RevDistrict credit application",
  "termsVersion": "2026-09-24",
  "application": {
    "application_type": "individual",
    "acceptance_of_terms": "yes"
  }
}
```

The shortened example omits personal fields; use the shared schema for the full contract. Most original source field names are preserved for mapping, but this envelope is ours. A successful relay must durably accept and deduplicate the request, then return 2xx JSON **`{"accepted": true}`**. Only then does the website show a receipt and clear the form. A timeout, redirect, rejected response or missing acceptance returns an unconfirmed state and a reference; the visitor is asked to call before resubmitting. No automatic retries or credit-approval claims are made.

Unsubmitted information exists only in component memory. Unlike the old script, this form does not save incomplete identity/contact details to browser storage or transmit partial applications. The website does not persist financial application bodies to files, a database or logs. Logs include only a delivery event and reference. Keep request-body capture disabled in hosting, observability and proxy tooling as well.

Before setting the enabled flag, the dealer/provider must confirm the field mapping, actual lender-routing behavior, accepted disclosure/authorization text, retention/access controls, encrypted storage at the receiver, trusted proxy and shared abuse protection, and a provider-confirmed test receipt. This local implementation and its synthetic fixture tests do not establish provider approval or legal compliance. No real credit application was submitted during development.

## Video replacement

Two independent slots live in `src/lib/media.ts`. Change `src`, `poster`, title and caption there. The home and story pages share the welcome slot; the story page adds the second slot. Supplied media is hosted locally, opt-in, and has native playback controls. No third-party social embeds, autoplay audio, or social feeds are needed.

- Welcome slot: the supplied Instagram showroom tour, compressed for web, with its original burned-in speech captions retained.
- Story slot: a short silent behind-the-scenes excerpt from the supplied YouTube video.

For future spoken replacements, provide accurate captions (WebVTT via `<track>` or burned captions) and a transcript. Do not use the old clip's captions for new footage.

## Contact and privacy

Address, phone, email and opening hours were verified against the current dealership contact page. The privacy page covers the implemented data paths rather than copying assertions about systems that are not connected. The dealer should review its policy and actual providers before launch.

## Decorative background films

The header/background films are separate from listing photos and the two opt-in owner slots. `AmbientFilm` supplies local posters, muted loops and explicit pause controls for Sell / Trade, Financing, Inventory, Contact and The District. They have no dependency on the DMS. Their sources and rebuild script are recorded in `CONTENT-AND-SOURCES.md` and `VISUAL-REFINEMENT.md`.
