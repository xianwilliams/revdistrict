# Verification and review handoff

Checked September 24, 2026 against the compiled Next.js application, served through the included `server.cjs`. The review preview is running at **http://localhost:3001**. To restart it: `npm run build`, then `PORT=3001 node server.cjs`. Normal development uses `npm run dev` at http://localhost:3000.

## Completed checks

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier | Passed |
| Production build and custom-server startup | Passed |
| Dependency audit | 0 reported vulnerabilities |
| Domain tests | 13 passed: original 7 plus individual/joint application validation, two-year history, conditional trade data, consent, inactive data stripping, consignment and text intents |
| Browser tests | 18 passed: original 14 journeys plus homepage priorities/internal application links, safe unconfigured application, consignment/text submissions, and stacked phone service headings |
| Accessibility scan | Zero Axe WCAG 2 A/AA and 2.1 AA violations across ten routes, including the four new pages; zero violations on all five enabled joint-application steps in the isolated fixture |
| HTTPS integration fixtures | Passed: authenticated feed and leads, plus authenticated financial delivery, durable receipt, rejected/cross-origin/oversize/honeypot requests, sensitive error redaction, native POST fallback without JavaScript, and a complete joint application in Chromium |
| Responsive route captures | 42 page/viewport combinations returned 200 with no horizontal overflow, page JavaScript errors or broken loaded images |
| Motion captures | Original 51 home and 30 interior states, plus 9 new client-feedback states across desktop, touch-emulated phone and reduced motion; latest states have no overflow or page errors |

Commands and fixtures live in `tests/` and `scripts/`. The local integration fixtures use temporary certificates and synthetic data; they send nothing to the dealership or provider.

## September 24 feedback pass

Homepage priorities now appear before the driving-style selector. The application is native, preserves vehicle selection from car pages, supports individual/joint applicants, conditionally requests prior residence/employment and trade information, and uses a dedicated authenticated delivery contract. The preview blocks financial information entry while that contract is unconfigured. New consignment and text-back requests extend the existing lead form; general contact, valuation and vehicle inquiry remain available. No application links return to the legacy dealership website.

`research/client-feedback/` contains fresh full-page captures for all twelve content routes at 1440×1000, 1366×768 and 390×844, plus six routes at 360×640. Desktop hero/section density, gold, homepage priorities, financing, consignment, application and phone service headings were visually inspected. `motion-results.json` and its nine viewport captures cover the new service section, finance options and consignment process with normal and reduced motion. Icons below the viewport remain unrevealed until reached; reduced motion keeps all content visible.

Regression checks first reproduced the finance header-order override, unsafe native GET fallback when JavaScript is unavailable, and two-column phone service headings. The fixes move the application-specific header after the global rule, provide an explicit POST fallback and no-script guidance, and stack the new phone headings. Automated accessibility scans also caught two links relying on color alone; both now have persistent underlines.

## Visual evidence

Ignored `research/technical-type/` contains the final uppercase Inter complete-page and opening captures at 1440×1000 and 390×844 for all content pages, plus home/inventory/vehicle at 360×640. Images were allowed to decode before captures. `results.json` records response status, overflow, page errors and broken images.

Ignored `research/editorial-motion/` contains six hero scroll positions, four home scenes and seven representative film frames for each of three modes: 1440×1000 standard motion, 390×844 touch emulation and 1440×1000 reduced motion. `results.json` records media, headline, vertical rail and dial transforms, sheen position, and each selected video source and dimensions. Reduced motion leaves the film paused by default and disables the scroll transforms. The static tilted instrument and all controls remain usable.

Final uppercase Inter pixels were inspected for home, inventory, vehicle detail, story, finance, trade and contact, including intermediate hero states and the brightest film cuts. The revision corrected a streamed-layout measurement race affecting gold sheen, unstable SVG rounding during hydration, phone chapter sizing, a team-film caption overlap and a distracting road cut. The text scrim was strengthened behind the desktop headline. Original inventory photography remains factual and varies by listing.

Source cut review and the final replacement road sequence are retained in ignored `research/montage-proof/` and `research/montage-final-proof/`. Both final MP4s are 22 seconds at 24 fps with no audio stream: desktop 1600×800, 5.55 MB; phone 540×720, 1.91 MB. No burned subtitles or graphic titles appear in the hero reel.

## Latest interior and typography evidence

`research/interior-motion/` contains 30 final captures of the new interior sections at 1440×1000 standard motion, 390×844 touch emulation and 390×844 reduced motion. The recorded states cover Financing intro/process/FAQ, Sell / Trade intro/carousel, The District intro/settled logo, Contact intro/details and Inventory intro. All states have no horizontal overflow or JavaScript errors. Drawn icons finish at zero stroke offset; the logo finishes at opacity 1; background films pause when offscreen and default to paused under reduced motion.

The client rejected the previous serif direction. All main headings, film chapters, display captions and vehicle titles now use upright Inter, with uppercase display roles. Bodoni and Manrope are removed from dependencies. The font is self-hosted and preloaded through `next/font/local`; body text stays sentence case and labels retain IBM Plex Mono. The final 19-route capture pass confirmed no broken loaded images, page errors or overflow at desktop, 390px and selected 360px layouts.

## Local loading comparison

The repeatable script is `scripts/performance-review.mjs`. It uses a fresh Chromium context, disabled HTTP cache, 1.6 Mbps download/150 ms latency/4× CPU throttling, a 1440px desktop or 390px DPR2 phone viewport, and reduced motion. It waits for the first photo to decode, then 1.2 seconds, and measures the next-photo click through decode. Both comparison runs use the Acura listing.

| Measurement | Before | Final |
|---|---:|---:|
| Phone LCP | 3,288 ms | 2,440 ms |
| Phone next-photo click to decoded image | 433 ms | 113 ms |
| Desktop LCP | 3,504 ms | 3,644 ms |
| Desktop next-photo click to decoded image | 452 ms | 113 ms |
| Phone primary image width | 1,600px | 1,080px |
| Desktop primary image width | 1,600px | 1,440px |

Raw evidence is in ignored `research/performance/before.json` and `research/performance/technical-type.json`. These are individual local lab runs, not a production Core Web Vitals pass. Phone LCP and photo changes improved; desktop LCP did not improve in this run. Confirm deployed caching, host response time and real-device performance before launch. Background videos defer until the page has loaded, and only play while visible.

## Design and feel check

The brief was self-authored under the user's explicit creative delegation. A multi-entry showroom was chosen because many visitors land directly on a car. An uninterrupted film, locked narrative, or pinned scroll sequence would obstruct that route; a plain document or utility-only dashboard would underserve the requested brand experience. The implementation uses native Next.js markup and custom GSAP choreography rather than shipping the unused standalone Scrollcraft engine.

The signature is the driving-style selector: a rev-counter needle changes with the selected collection, the real cars change, and the choice continues into inventory search. The revised hero has independently moving film, typography and fine framing planes. Its three chapter controls expose the cars, people and driving scenes. Two separate supplied-video slots provide the personal introduction. The current type system, film edit and user-directed refinement are documented in `VISUAL-REFINEMENT.md`.

The latest inspected sequence reads as arrival → service choice → driving-style selection → inventory → people → invitation. The client-requested service priorities now precede the interactive stage, while the car-selection section remains the experiential peak. No empty pinned scrolling was added. The ending resolves with a visit invitation, hours and phone. Phone composition uses a separately framed portrait reel, large headline and clear primary action. The fingerprint registry was empty before this build; its first row records the result.

## Independent review

The engineering-standard simplicity review found the component structure appropriately small. Its concrete findings were addressed: source mileage/body parsing, phone validation, test-drive intent including repeated clicks, unknown facts in metadata, and generated imagery as a missing-photo fallback. Missing listing images now receive neutral text. The supplied welcome clip already has burned speech captions; the second excerpt is silent. The independent second-pass editorial review found the component structure appropriately simple and identified a remounted live region; its changing key was removed so selection announcements use a stable region. The third-pass review caught a duplicated Story hero tween and insufficient FAQ-photo overscan for parallax; both were fixed. A final read-only review of local Inter loading and the mounted next-photo prefetch found no new actionable issues. No unresolved review finding is being hidden behind the passing tests.

The September 24 independent review found the shared finance descriptors and LeadForm extensions appropriately simple. It identified the native GET fallback and header order described above; both were fixed with regressions. No new framework or generic provider abstraction was introduced.

## What remains unverified

- Real dealr.cloud export/API authorization, mapping, update cadence and CRM lead receipt. The app's normalized JSON contract is not a claim that dealr.cloud already exposes that shape. The provider handoff is in `INTEGRATIONS.md`.
- Namecheap hosting-plan capability, server limits, DNS, TLS and deployed performance. A registrar account alone does not establish Node hosting. No public deployment or DNS changes were made.
- The approved financial relay, provider field mapping, lender routing, production receipt and disclosure approval. Native application code is complete and tested against an isolated fixture; live information entry remains disabled until configured. Provider/host encryption, access controls, request-body logging restrictions and shared abuse protection must be confirmed before enabling it.
- Real iPhone/Android hardware, Safari, low-power video behavior and manual screen-reader evaluation. Phone checks here are Chromium emulation, not physical-device testing.
- Dealer approval of rebrand copy, retained business contact details, video choices, privacy notice and final live inventory/lead flow.

For the human review, start at home and open each of the three prominent service links. Review Consignment and its consultation form, Financing and its application steps, then Contact → Request a text back. Open the Acura listing and use its financing button to confirm the vehicle carries into the application. Also check the smaller desktop sections and phone layouts. The unconfigured preview deliberately does not claim that any form message was sent; credit fields remain disabled until an approved connection exists.
