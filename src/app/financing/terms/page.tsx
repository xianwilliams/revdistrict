        Please review this information before submitting a credit application.
        Each person named on a joint application must review and accept the
        authorization.

        <h2>Your authorization</h2>
        <p>{financeAuthorization}</p>
        <h2>What happens after you apply</h2>
        <p>
          The dealership and its approved financing providers review the
          information you submit. They may request documents or contact you to
          verify details. An application, payment estimate or confirmation of
          receipt is not a financing approval, rate offer, reservation or
          purchase agreement. Available programs and terms depend on review of
          your application and the vehicle.
        </p>
        <h2>Information used for your application</h2>
        <p>
          The application requests contact and identity details, residence and
          employment history, income, and optional vehicle and trade-in
          information. When authorized, consumer reports and verification
          information may also be used to assess financing. See our{" "}
          <Link href="/privacy-policy">privacy notice</Link> for information
          about website data handling and contact the dealership for its
          financial privacy disclosures.
        </p>
        <h2>Joint applications</h2>
        <p>
          Choose a joint application only when both people intend to apply
          together. The co-applicant should enter their own information and
          provide their own authorization. Do not submit another person’s
          information without their participation and consent.
        </p>
        <h2>Communication and corrections</h2>
        <p>
          The team may contact you about your application. Text-message consent
          is separate and optional. If you need to correct information or are
          unsure whether an application was received, call{" "}
          <a href={site.phoneHref}>{site.phone}</a> before submitting again. Do
          not email Social Security numbers or other sensitive financial
          information.
